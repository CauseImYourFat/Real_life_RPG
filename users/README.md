# Users Folder

Each user gets their own folder:
- `users/john/` - John's data folder
- `users/mary/` - Mary's data folder

Inside each user folder:
- `password.txt` - Encrypted password
- `profile.json` - User profile data
- `skills.json` - Skills data
- `health.json` - Health data
- `preferences.json` - User preferences

Simple and clean! No complex databases needed.
